# Fantasy Football Luck Analyzer

The **Fantasy Football Luck Analyzer** is a web-based tool built with Streamlit that helps you analyze how "lucky" or "unlucky" you've been in your ESPN Fantasy Football league. By leveraging advanced metrics and visualizations, this app provides insights into how factors like opponent performance, scheduling, and scoring expectations have influenced your team's success.

## Features

### 1. Opponent Underperformance
- Visualizes how much your opponents underperformed or overperformed compared to their projected scores.
- Positive values indicate opponents scored less than expected, while negative values indicate they scored more than expected.
- **Example**: If your opponent was projected to score 100 points but only scored 80, your luck index is +20.

### 2. Pythagorean Expectation
- Compares your actual wins to your expected wins based on the Pythagorean Expectation formula.
- Teams with a positive Luck Index have won more games than expected.
- Teams with a negative Luck Index have won fewer games than expected.

### 3. Scatterplot Luck
- A scatterplot visualizing your team's performance relative to the league average.
  - **X-axis**: Points scored (relative to league average)
  - **Y-axis**: Points allowed (relative to league average)
  - Blue dots represent wins, red dots represent losses
  - Highlights "Lucky Wins" and "Unlucky Losses" regions

### 4. Scheduling Luck
- A table showing how each team would have performed if they had played every other team's schedule.
- Helps you understand how much your record was influenced by your schedule rather than your team's strength.
